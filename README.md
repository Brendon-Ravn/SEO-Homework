# Refactoring-Homework

## Description

   This website needed to have its code cleaned up. There were broken links, huge image files, etc. I
went in and used semantics and new classes to try and fix the flow of the code as well. The main goal
of this project was to fix the website for search engine optimization. Alt tags were added, page title
was changed, and classes were fixed.
